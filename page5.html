<h3 id="subheader"> History of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park</h3>    
  <p id = "ptwo">Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park was originally called Bishan Park when it was completed in 1988.15 id="barhead"The 42-hectare park cost the Housing and Development Board (HDB) over S$8 million to develop and was built to serve as a green buffer between Ang Mo Kio and Bishan new towns.  </p>

  <p id = "ptwo">In 1992, Bishan Park became the first park in Singapore to be made accessible via the park connector network. The five-kilometre stretch linked Bishan Park to Braddell Road, and was part of the Parks and Recreation Department’s vision to build an island-wide network of corridors along drainage canals that would allow users to jog or cycle from one park to another seamlessly.</p>
 <h3 id="subheader"> Rejuvenation under the ABC Waters Programme </h3>

    <p id = "ptwo">As part of PUB’s ABC Waters Programme, the canal running through Bishan Park was identified for major upgrading in the 2000s. The project was then expanded to include the rejuvenation of Bishan Park, and became a collaborative effort by PUB and National Parks Board (formerly the Parks and Recreation Department). In redesigning the waterway and park, landscape architects from Atelier Dreiseitl Asia (now Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl) were engaged to work with engineers from CH2M Hill.</p>
    
    <p id = "ptwo">In addition, a cleansing biotope was created to provide a water cleansing system for the river and ponds at the park without the use of chemicals. The cleansing biotope consists of carefully selected plants that help to treat the water naturally by filtering out pollutants and, at the same time, beautify the park. Some of the treated water is channelled to the Water Playground for shallow water play. A network of bioswales, or vegetated open channels, was also introduced to slow down water conveyance and facilitate the removal of coarse pollutants.</p>
