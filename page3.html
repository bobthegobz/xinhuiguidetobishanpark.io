  <h3><i>Lush green spaces, a cool water playground, heaps of shaded paths, and great cafes – what's not to love about uber family-friendly Bishan-Ang Mo Kio park?</i></h3>
  <p id="ptwo">Bishan Ang Mo Kio Park is famous as a recreational venue and is one of the diverse locations of fauna and flora making it a haven for nature lovers. As part of the PUB’s Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters (ABC) Programme, the old canal at the center of the park was refurbished to create a flowing waterway. This unique waterway is the home of a variety of fishes and tortoises, as well as wildflowers on its banks. Everyday, people visit the park to jog, cycle, play with their dogs, meet friends and take photos of the beautiful spots in the park. Some just simply come to the park to eat at the very famous McDonald's near the river.</p>
