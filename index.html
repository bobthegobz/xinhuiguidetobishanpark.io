  <h3 style ><i>As one of the largest urban parks in central Singapore, Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is a great place for everyone to have a fun day out.</i></h3>
    <center><p style = "width:60%">Bishan Park is one of the most popular parks in the heartlands of Singapore. As part of a much-needed park upgrade and plans to improve the capacity of the Kallang channel along the edge of the park, works were carried out simultaneously to transform the utilitarian concrete channel into a naturalized river, creating new spaces for the community to enjoy. </center></p>

    <p>At Bishan Park, a 2.7 km straight concrete drainage channel has been converted into a sinuous, 3.2 km long natural river, that meanders through the park. Sixty-two hectares of park space has been tastefully redesigned to accommodate the dynamic process of a river system which includes fluctuating water levels, while providing maximum benefit for park users. Three playgrounds, restaurants, a new vantage point constructed using the recycled walls of the old concrete channel, and plenty of open green spaces complement the natural wonder of an ecologically restored river in the heartlands of the city. This is a place to take your shoes off, and get closer to water and nature.</p>
